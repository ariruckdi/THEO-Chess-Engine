# THEO-Chess-Engine
Meet THEO, the Tiny Helpless Erroneus Open chess engine, a little open-source chess AI I created to beat my friend at chess.
It currently plays kinda ok, is really slow and basically made of bugs and atrocious code. Very easy to beat for experienced players.

To get started, type "help" or "?" in the console.

Features:
  - Very slow engine
  - Human vs Human, AI vs Human and AI vs AI mode
  - FEN reading
  - Graphics in Unity, engine in C#
